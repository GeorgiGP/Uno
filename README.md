### The goal of the game UNO is to play all your cards before the other players.

## MJT Game Rules

### 1. Starting the Game:
- Each player receives 7 random cards.
- The deck is placed face down, called the "draw pile."
- The top card is drawn and placed in a new pile, called the "discard pile."
- A random player starts first, and turns proceed clockwise.

### 2. During the Game:
- On your turn, you must find a matching card from your hand that corresponds to the top card on the "discard pile" by number, color, or symbol (action card).
- Example: If the top card on the discard pile is a "blue 8," the player must place a "blue" card or an "8" of any color.
- The player may also play an action card (see action cards section below), such as a blue "skip."

On your turn, you have two options:
Letâ€™s assume you have the cards a1, a2, ..., an in your hand, forming set A := {a1, a2, ..., an}. From these, only a subset B can be played, where B âŠ† A.
- If |B| > 0, you may play any card from B. The turn then moves to the next player.
- If |B| = 0, you must draw a card. The turn then moves to the next player.

### 3. Action Cards (Jokers)
- "Wild" - The player who plays this card chooses the color for the next move. If drawn at the start of the game, the color is chosen randomly. This card can be played at any time.
- "+4" - The player who plays this card chooses the color for the next move, and the next player draws 4 cards and loses their turn. This card can be played at any time.
- "+2" - The next player draws 2 cards and skips their turn. This card must match the color or follow another "+2."
- "Reverse" - Reverses the order of play. This card must match the color or follow another "reverse."
- "Skip" - The next player skips their turn. This card must match the color or follow another "skip."
- No other special cards exist.

## Condition
The system should consist of two parts:
1. A server that stores ongoing games and their participants.
2. Clients that can participate in at most one game at a time.

## Disconnection Handling
- If a client loses connection to the server while participating in a game, they are not removed from the game.
- When they log in again, they continue playing with the cards they had before disconnection.

## Error Messages
- If the program is used incorrectly, an appropriate error message should be displayed.
- If a system error occurs, the user should only see relevant information. Technical details such as stack traces should be logged in a file.
- Example: Instead of displaying "IO exception occurred: connection reset," a more appropriate message would be "Unable to connect to the server. Try again later or contact the administrator with the logs in <path_to_logs_file>."
- Server errors should be logged, including additional details (such as which user request caused the error) and stack traces.

### Feature to be add in the future:
- "UNO" can only be declared when a player has exactly 1 card left.
- "STOP UNO" can be declared against a player with exactly 1 card who has not declared "UNO." The caught player must draw 2 cards.
